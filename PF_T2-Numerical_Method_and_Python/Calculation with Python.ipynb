    "\n",
    "Hint:\n",
    "1. This data structure will decompose the data structure we have before into more independent parts. So you don't rely on too much method to operate these things, just regular function is good.\n",
    "2. The functions choosed above are good choice if you are frustrated in finding a function to play with.\n",
    "3. The difficult part might be the grammar part and algorithm implementation part. About the grammar, please utilise your search engine. As for the algorithm implementation part, I already did that, and all you need to do is change the interface to your data structure.\n",
    "4. 3D graph is not easy to plot. While, why not copy & paste them from the example above and modify it to fit your needs?"
